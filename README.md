# USM - Uncomplicated Server Manager

This CLI tool is meant to manage servers just like cPanel but through the terminal.

Nowadays I work deploying PHP apps through a managed server.
It'd be cool to be able to do the same in a unmanaged server using only the terminal.
I think the first step to make this tool useful is to make it be able to tell
me if the server has everything needed to run the app.

## TO DO

- [x] Add command to update the system
- [] Check installed tools
  - [] neededginx
  - [] php
  - [] composer
  - [] node
  - [] npm
  - [] ufw
  - [] certbot
  - [] python
  - [] python3-certbot-nginx
  - [] mysql-server
  - [] mysql_secure_installation
  - [] sqlite3
